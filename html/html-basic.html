            <b>HTML</b><br>
            HTML, an abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language, is the programming language that allows developers to create the elements on websites. For example, you are reading html right now! I am using a <em>Code Editor</em> to edit the contents of this <em>HTML</em> file, and seeing it in the browser. Here is what I am looking at whilst writing this:
            <br>
            <div class="info-img-wrapper">
                <img class="info-img" src="Screenshot from 2023-07-27 22-33-35.png" />
            </div>
            <b>Syntax</b><br>
            HTML has a pointy look to it due to it's <em>syntax</em>. It is reliant on <em>spacing</em> to make the code look organized and readable.
            <br><br>
            <b>Web Development</b><br>
            HTML is also often seen with other website (also referred to as front-end) programming languages like Cascading Style-Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS). CSS makes your HTML look <b>beautiful</b>, and JS makes your HTML <b>do stuff</b> (functionality).
            <b>Syntax Continued</b><br>
            If you look at the screenshot that I included earlier, you will notice that my HTML document (and all other HTML documents) will have something in common. Each <b>red</b> word that you see is called a <b>tag</b>. A tag lets the browser running the HTML know that that specific tag, and the contents inside of it, are different, and have different functions. For example, the <span class="code">&lt;button&gt;</span> tag tells the browser to get the automatic style for it. This is so that the button appears on screen, and looks specific to each browser. Eventually, when you learn <b>JavaScript</b>, you will learn how to add functionality to your web page.
