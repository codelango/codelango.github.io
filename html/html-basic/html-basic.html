            <b>HTML</b><br>
            HTML, an abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language, is the programming language that allows developers to create the elements on websites. For example, you are reading html right now! I am using a <em>Code Editor</em> to edit the contents of this <em>HTML</em> file, and seeing it in the browser. Here is what I am looking at whilst writing this:
            <br>
            <div class="info-img-wrapper">
                <img class="info-img" src="Screenshot from 2023-07-27 22-33-35.png" />
            </div>
            <b>Syntax</b><br>
            HTML has a pointy look to it due to it's <em>syntax</em>. It is reliant on <em>spacing</em> to make the code look organized and readable.
            <br><br>
            <b>Web Development</b><br>
            HTML is also often seen with other website (also referred to as front-end) programming languages like Cascading Style-Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS). CSS makes your HTML look <b>beautiful</b>, and JS makes your HTML <b>do stuff</b> (functionality).
            <br><br>
            <b>Syntax Continued</b><br>
            If you look at the screenshot that I included earlier, you will notice that my HTML document (and all other HTML documents) will have something in common. Each <b>red</b> word that you see is called a <b>tag</b>. A tag lets the browser running the HTML know that that specific tag, and the contents inside of it, are different, and have different functions. For example, the <span class="code">&lt;button&gt;</span> tag tells the browser to get the automatic style for it. This is so that the button appears on screen, and looks specific to each browser. Eventually, when you learn <b>JavaScript</b>, you will learn how to add functionality to your web page.

        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <b>Writing HTML</b><br>
            Now that you know what HTML is and where it can be used, it is time to start coding in HTML. First, you need to install a code editor of your choice. Here are a few good ones:
            <ol>
                <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                <li>Atom</li>
                <li>Sublime Text</li>
                <li>Notepad++</li>
            </ol>
            If you decide to use <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, you should download the extension called "Live Server", created my Microsoft. This allows the browser to automatically refresh with the new changes once you have saved your HTML. If you are not using Visual Studio Code, do not worry. You will just need to save your code, then <em>refresh</em> once you get to the browser.
            <br><br><b>Your First HTML</b><br>
            In your code editor, go to <em>file</em> > <em>new</em>, and creating a file ending in <b>.html</b>. In most cases, you should name your file: "index.html". This is not necessary, but is a naming standard. This is how web hosting services, like <em>GitHub</em> know that this is the default/root file. Now, in that document, write the following contents:
            <!-- &gt; &lt; -->
            <br>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my first web page!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                </code>
            </div>
            <br>
            Once you have inserted this code, press "ctrl" then "s" to save the file. If you are in visual studio code, right click on the file (if you have Live Server installed), then click "Open with Live Server". If you are not using visual studio code, navigate to the directory that you saved your file, and double click
